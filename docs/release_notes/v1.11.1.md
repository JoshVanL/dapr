# Dapr 1.11.1

## Fixed an issue with Service Invocation on Kubernetes clusters with the permission enforcement admission controller enabled.

### Problem

Updating Dapr from 1.10 to 1.11 on Kubernetes clusters which have the permission enforcement admission controller enabled gives the following error
when using Service Invocation:

```
unable to create Dapr service for wrapper, service: test/test-dapr, err:
services \"test-dapr\" is forbidden: cannot set blockOwnerDeletion if an
ownerReference refers to a resource you can't set finalizers on:
```

### Impact

Since v1.11.0 Service Invocation on Kubernetes clusters which have the permission enforcement admission controller enabled is unusable.

This is particularly problematic when for OpenShift clusters, as they have this admission controller enabled by default.

### Root cause

When using the permission enforcement admission controller on Kubernetes,
Service Invocation fails because the operator is unable to create or update
Services.

### Solution

We updated the Kubernetes RBAC permissions used by the Dapr Operator.

## Fixed a Goroutine leak in Actor reminders and timers.

### Problem

The daprd sidecar process would increase in memory over time when using Actor
reminders and timers.

### Impact

Using Actor reminders and timers in Dapr 1.11.0 and earlier could cause a goroutine leak that would grow over time.
This could cause increase CPU utilization and/or memory exhaustion.

### Root cause

Goroutines were not being cleaned up when reminders and timers were fired.

### Solution

Goroutines are now cleaned up when reminders and timers are fired.

## MongoDB Actor State Store: Fixed an issue with storing Actor Reminders

### Problem

Actor Reminders without data were stored incorrectly and the empty (null) data was subsequently interpreted as a string value. Everytime an Actor Reminder was updated it reencoded the existing encoding, causing exponential growth in ActorReminder data leading up to the MongoDB document size limit. Other problems include the incorrect storage of the actor reminder period.

### Impact

Since v1.10.5 (and also in v1.11.0), Actor Reminders used with MongoDB as Actor State Store were effectively unusable. While some reminders written or updated with affected versions may work, all reminders written with the impacted versions should be considered unrecoverable as some reminder data will have been lost or corrupted.

### Root cause

In 1.10.5 we addressed several actor reminder performance problems through a significant refactor.
We updated the way Actor Reminders are serialized and stored in actor state stores, relying on JSON serialization using
a custom JSON Marshal function. This worked great for all actor state stores except for MongoDB which insists on BSON serialization
instead of JSON.

### Solution

We implemented a custom BSON Marshal function for our Actor Reminder struct so that the MongoDB state store can correctly serialize ActorReminder data.

## Fixed Dapr being unable to obtain the authentication token when using Managed Identity of Azure Web App

### Problem

When using Managed Identity of Azure Web App, Dapr errors with the following
"failed to create Azure Storage container myContainer: ChainedTokenCredential:
failed to acquire a token."

### Impact

Since v1.11.0, Daprd is unable to authenticate with Azure services.

### Root cause

The Azure MSI authentication library's timeout was too small, leading to
authentication failure before the token could be obtained.

### Solution

Dapr will now discover whether it is running in Azure Web App, and applies an
appropriate timeout for the authentication method.

## Fixed a problem where SQL Server keys could not be overwritten once set.

### Problem

Dapr would error when attempting to overwrite a TTL enabled key in SQL Server.

### Impact

Since v1.10.0, clients could not overwrite TTL enabled keys in the SQL Server
state store.

### Root cause

A condition in the SQL Server Set procedure meant TTL enabled keys could never
be written to.

### Solution

Fix the condition to allow TTL enabled keys to be overwritten.
