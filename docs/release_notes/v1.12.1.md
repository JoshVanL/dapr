## Security: Sentry and Injector only apply `daprsystem` Configuration from the control plane namespace

### Problem

Sentry and Injector will apply the `daprsystem` configuration from a non-control plane namespace if the namespace name is alphabetically higher than the control plane namespace name.

### Impact

Accidentally or maliciously, a Kubernetes user can write a Configuration in a non-control plane namespace that will be applied by Sentry and Injector.
This can re-write the Sentry CA, disable mTLS, or otherwise bring down the entire Dapr cluster.

### Root cause

Sentry and Injector currently list Configurations, before matching on the list for the `daprsystem` Configuration, without filtering for namespaces.

### Solution

Update Sentry and Injector to only get the `daprsystem` Configuration from the namespace where the Dapr control plane is installed, instead of listing all Configurations.

## Fixed Sentry rejecting valid requests from Daprd

### Problem

Daprds would fail to request an identity certificate from Sentry when residing in a Namespace or using a Service Account with a sufficiently long name.

### Impact

Daprds would fail to start, causing that application from joining the Dapr cluster.
Effects only the Dapr versio `v1.12.0`.

### Root cause

Sentry validates that clients cannot request for an app ID which is over 64 characters in length.
Sentry also still accepts requests which use the legacy identifier of `<namespace>:<service account>` which was not taken account for when doing the 64 character evaluation.

### Solution

Sentry now evaluates the actual app ID being requested, whether or not the client is using the legacy or app ID as the identifier.

## Fixed RabbitMQ not returning error when initialising component

### Problem

A RabitMQ component may be considered healthy, when in fact it failed to initialise.

### Impact

Dapr or downstream consumers of Dapr would consider RabitMQ components to be healthy when in fact it they were not, causing improper reporting of status.

### Root cause

RabbitMQ was not returning an error when initialising a component, causing Dapr to consider the component healthy.

### Solution

IF RabbitMQ errors during initialisation the error is now returned, causing Dapr to consider the component to have failed initialisation.

## Fixed returning of HTTP status code in HTTP service invocation with resiliency enabled

### Problem

With Resiliency enabled, in case of HTTP service invocation, if one application sends error status codes (HTTP codes <200 or >=400), Dapr returns a response with a generic 500 error, instead of the actual response error code.

### Impact

Applications will receive the wrong status code in case of HTTP service invocation returning a failure error code with Resiliency enabled.

### Root cause

A bug was discovered in how errors were handled when Resiliency was enabled, causing all errors from the application to be "swallowed" by Dapr.

### Solution

Resiliency code now returns the correct status code to the application.

## Fixed Dapr Runtime panic for malformed/unexpected workflow URLs

### Problem

When invoking workflows with invalid URLs, Daprd would panic.

### Impact

Daprd would panic, causing the application to no longer be connected to the Dapr cluster.

### Root cause

The Daprd metrics handler for workflows did not correctly handle malformed or unexpected URLs, and would panic if the URL was not in the expected format.

### Solution

The Daprd metrics handler for workflows now correctly handles malformed or unexpected URLs.
