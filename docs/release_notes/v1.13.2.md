## Fix incorrect content-length being sent to HTTP published message

### Problem

Published messages to HTTP application server report a content-length error and are not processed.

### Impact

PubSub messages from some PubSubs cannot be processed by the application.

### Root cause

The content-length reported by the PubSub broker message was copied to the message sent to the application's HTTP server.
This content-length may not match the final message length sent to the application's HTTP server, resulting in the mesage being rejected.

### Solution

Filter out the content-length header from the PubSub broker message before sending it to the application's HTTP server.
