# Dapr 1.10.8

## Fixed Dapr accepting components with impossible names in self hosted mode.

### Problem

When running in self hosted mode, Dapr would parse and accept components which
had impossible names, making them unusable.

### Impact

Impacts users running Dapr in self hosted mode.

### Root cause

Dapr was not validating the component name when running in self hosted mode.

### Solution

Added validation of the component name when running in self hosted mode.
Components with impossible names will be rejected during startup.
