# Dapr 1.11.5

**Important:** Users who rely on gRPC-to-gRPC service invocation (legacy, non proxy-based) are encouraged to upgrade to Dapr 1.11.5 before upgrading existing deployments to 1.12.x, to prevent temporary issues during a rollout of Dapr 1.12.x.

This update contains the following security fixes:

- Security: prevent Sentry and Injector from applying the `daprsystem` Configuration from a non control plane namespace.

Additionally, this patch release contains bug fixes:

- Fixed: gRPC-to-gRPC service invocation when the `ServiceInvocationStreaming` feature is enabled. Users who rely on gRPC-to-gRPC service invocation (legacy, non proxy-based) are encouraged to upgrade to Dapr 1.11.5 before upgrading existing deployments to 1.12.x, to prevent temporary issues during a rollout of Dapr 1.12.x.
- Fixed: Fix invoke remote stream from closing stream before EOF
- Fixed: Downgrading from 1.12 to 1.11
- Fixed: Return HTTP status code in HTTP service invocation with resiliency enabled

## Security: Sentry and Injector only apply `daprsystem` Configuration from the control plane namespace

### Problem

Sentry and Injector will apply the `daprsystem` configuration from a non-control plane namespace if the namespace name is alphabetically higher than the control plane namespace name.

### Impact

Accidentally or maliciously, a Kubernetes user can write a Configuration in a non-control plane namespace that will be applied by Sentry and Injector.
This can re-write the Sentry CA, disable mTLS, or otherwise bring down the entire Dapr cluster.

### Root cause

Sentry and Injector currently _list_ Configurations, before matching on the list for the `daprsystem` Configuration.

### Solution

Update Sentry and Injector to only _get_ the `daprsystem` Configuration, instead of listing all Configurations.

## Fixed: gRPC-to-gRPC service invocation when the `ServiceInvocationStreaming` feature is enabled

### Problem

When the `ServiceInvocationStreaming` preview flag is enabled, the `type_url` property is removed when performing service invocation. This can cause failures when performing the  gRPC-to-gRPC service invocation (legacy, non proxy-based).

### Impact

Aside from the immediate impact on users who have the `ServiceInvocationStreaming` feature flag enabled, this issue can also impact users who rely on the (legacy, non proxy-based) gRPC-to-gRPC service invocation capabilities of Dapr, and who are in the process of upgrading to Dapr 1.12.x.

In fact, a Dapr 1.12.x sidecar would always attempt to communicate with Dapr 1.11.x using the streaming APIs, so using Dapr 1.12.x to invoke Dapr 1.11.x would cause the issue to appear even if `ServiceInvocationStreaming` is not enabled in Dapr 1.11.x

### Root cause

An issue was detected in the internal implementation of service invocation when streaming was enabled.

### Solution

We fixed the issue in Dapr 1.12.0 and 1.11.5.

## Fixed: Fix invoke remote stream from closing stream before EOF

### Problem

If an invoke stream is using resiliency, then service invocation will return with an EOF error rather than successfully returning the result.

### Impact

When `ServiceInvocationStreaming` is enabled, service invocation is unusable when using resiliency.

### Root cause

A bug in the code meant that the gRPC stream was closed before the EOF was sent to the client.

### Solution

Fix the code so that the EOF is sent before the stream is closed.

## Fixed: Downgrading from 1.12 to 1.11

### Problem

When downgrading from 1.12 to 1.11, the Dapr sidecar injector will fail to inject the sidecar into pods, printing CA verification errors in the logs.

### Impact

Users who downgrade the Dapr installation from 1.12 to 1.11 will result in their Dapr cluster being in broken state.

### Root cause

1.12 made a change that the Injector's serving certificate is now signed by the Dapr CA, rather than a separate CA managed through Helm.
The 1.11 Helm chart will always use an existing CA in the Webhook Configuration if it exists, meaning the serving certificate and CA will mismatch on a downgrade.

### Solution

The 1.11 Helm chart will correctly update the webhook Configuration to use the Dapr CA when downgrading from 1.12 to 1.11.

## Fixed: Return HTTP status code in HTTP service invocation with resiliency enabled

### Problem

With Resiliency enabled, in case of http service invocation, if one application sends error status codes (http code <200 or >399), Dapr instead of forwarding the received status code, converts it to 500.

### Impact

Applications will receive the wrong status code in case of Service Invocation returning non 200-399 with Resiliency enabled.

### Root cause

Resiliency would consider a non-successful code as a retryable error, and would return a 500 to the application.

### Solution

Resiliency code now returns the correct status code to the application.
